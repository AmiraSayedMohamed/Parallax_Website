# Parallax Website Project

Welcome to the Parallax Website Project! This project was developed during my internship at Cedge, where I worked as a web development intern. The aim was to create a visually appealing and interactive website utilizing the parallax scrolling effect.

## Overview

The Parallax Website Project is a modern and dynamic web page designed to showcase the power of parallax scrolling, where background images move slower than foreground images, creating an immersive depth effect as the user scrolls through the page. This technique enhances the user experience by adding an element of depth and motion to a static web page.

## Features

- **Parallax Scrolling Effect**: Smooth scrolling animations that provide a sense of depth.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Engaging components such as buttons, hover effects, and animations.
- **Modern UI/UX Design**: Clean and minimalist design focusing on usability and aesthetics.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Tested and functional across multiple web browsers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web pages and implementing the parallax effect.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and enhancing user experience.
